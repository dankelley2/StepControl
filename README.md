# StepControl
Python script for controlling two 28BYJ-48 Stepper motors with ULN2003 drivers.

-X axis (yaw) is limited to +-180 degrees from starting point, and is controlled with the A and D keys.
-Y axis (pitch) is limited to +-120 degrees from starting point, and is controlled with the W and S keys.
-X key is used to exit for now, I'm open to any control changes. As of right now, the exiting is a bit sketchy.

I'm pretty new to this (First github project!) and have only been working with python for a couple months now as a hobby.

Let me know what you think!
